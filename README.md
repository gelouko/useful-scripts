# Useful Scripts repo

Just a bunch of scripts that I write and want to keep for no reason :)

- aws
  - **find_and_tag**: List resource in an organization based on some filter and tags them (warning: not using paginator and this might cause incomplete scans depending on the resource quantity)
  - **list_frenzy**: The correct way to list aws resources in an account.
- tools
  - **structurizr_setup**: A setup script to make structurizr-cli's usage more friendly! :)
